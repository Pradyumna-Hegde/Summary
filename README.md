#### HTML Summary

- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to define our page content, structure and meaning.

- HTML uses 'elements' to describe (annotate) content.
- HTML elements typically have an opening tag, content and then closing tag. 
- You can also have void (empty) elements like images.
- You can also configure elements with attributes.

Learn more about all HTML elements on the MDN HTML element reference.

#### CSS Summary
- CSS (Cascading style sheets) is used for styling your page content

- Styles are assigned via property-value pairs

- You can assign styles via the "style" attribute

- To avoid code duplication, you typically use global styles (e.g. via the 'style' element) instead.

- Alternatively, you can work with external stylesheet files which you 'link' to.

- When working with CSS, concepts like "inheritance", specificity and the 'box model' should be understood.

- The application includes proper semantic tags such as header, main, section, and footer for better organization and accessibility. 

- Selectors and pseudo-selectors are used to target specific elements of the page for styling, while combinators are used to select elements based on their relationship to other elements.

- The application also uses Google Fonts to enhance the design and improve the overall user experience
